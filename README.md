This is the UI side of my project for the technical assessment. 

To get this to run, you will need Angular Cli version 9.1.7

Upon cloning, go into the repo and use "npm i" to install all the dependencies.

Then you can run "npm start" to start the application. The server will be hosted on "localhost:4200"

The username/password for the admin page is admin/hamandcheesesandwich
