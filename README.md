This is the UI side of my text subscription app.

The back-end side is in here: https://github.com/Barryxyz/Text-Subscription-App

Users are able to fill out a form to subscribe to the web app. 

Admins are able to type messages and send them to all of the subscribers. 

To get this to run, you will need Angular Cli version 9.1.7

Upon cloning, go into the repo and use "npm i" to install all the dependencies.

Then you can run "npm start" to start the application. The server will be hosted on "localhost:4200"

The username/password for the admin page is admin/hamandcheesesandwich
